When avaiable 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) should be used as it adds an additional layer of security for your account. This will help protect your account from unwanted account takeovers.

Before starting the process ensure you have a 2FA application, downloads for some popular ones can be found below [here](#downloads) - If you don't own a mobile device Authy has an option for Desktop users.

3. Select `Get started`

5. After scanning or entering the code manually you'll be shown the 6 diget code, enter it into the Authentication code field and click `Submit`

After finishing the setup you'll be shown backup codes, write these down and keep them safe. The backup codes are to be used when you've lost access to the device with the 2 Factor authentication application.
