### How to upgrade/downgrade your plan

To start the process you'll need to open a ticket in the billing area requesting an upgrade, click [here](https://billing.aurorahosts.com) to open the ticket.

Once opened you'll need to add the following information to the ticket:

* The service you want to upgrade or downgrade:
* The plan you wish to upgrade or downgrade to:

That's it! Once the ticket is open we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

:::info How much will it cost to upgrade/downgrade?
When upgrading you'll be charged a prorated price. The price is calulated by the amount of days remaning on your plan along with the plan you wish to upgrade to.

When downgrading your plan instead of being charged you'll be given credits, the amount given is still prorated and based on the days remaning and the plan you're downgrading to.
