### What’s an unmanaged VPS?

Unless otherwise specified, the VPS you purchase from us is unmanaged. This means that we might not offer support for some activities you carry out on your VPS.

Our support staff can and will offer you assistance with respect to applications they are familiar with, **including but not limited to:**
* Gta-V modifications such as (ALT:V, RageMP and others).
* Minecraft.
* Setting up an FTP server.
* Setting up Databases.
* Setting up your server.
* Port forwarding applications on your VPS.

:::info
We will always provide assistance for issues relating to the hardware and networking on VPSs,
and we can assist you with troubleshooting issues that may or may not be related to VPSs,
just because you have an unmanaged VPS does not mean we won't provide support for issues related to the VPS in general.

### What's a managed VPS?

With a managed VPS, we'll offer support for the vast majority of activities you perform on the server.
For example, if you run into problems with apps we don't completely understand, we'll do our best to try to assist.
A managed VPS also means that we'll keep the software operating on it updated,
as opposed to an unmanaged offering where you are responsible for controlling the actions you carry out on it.

**A managed VPS addition is not something we currently offer, but it might be an add-on in the future.**

**The sole addon that qualifies as managed is the "Pterodactyl addon,"
for which we update both the VPS software needed to run Pterodactyl and the underlying Pterodactyl software with the most recent updates.**

### In summary

No matter if you have an unmanaged or managed VPS we’ll still provide support for underlying issues related to the VPS
and our support team will attempt to provide support for applications in which they aren’t familiar with however support
isn’t always guaranteed for applications in which our support team isn’t familiar with.

**Unmanaged:**
* We’ll provide support for issues related to the VPS hardware and networking
* We’ll provide support for applications in which we’re familiar with, for all other applications support isn’t always guaranteed however we’ll provide our best efforts to assist you
* We aren’t responsible for keeping the software that you download on your VPS up to date.

**Managed:**
* We’ll keep the software and its’ underlying dependencies up to date on your VPS
* We’ll provide our best effort support for applications that our support team isn’t familiar with.
