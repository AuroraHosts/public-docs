### Why's my server suspended?

If your server is shown in a `suspended` state in the billing area it's likely because your last invoice is unpaid. Server suspensions occur 1 day after the due date of your server has passed.

### What can I do to revert the suspension?

Once a server is suspended you'll need to pay the unpaid invoice in your account. Once paid your server will be reinstated automatically within 5 minutes.
