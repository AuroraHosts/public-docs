If you're not satisfied with what you bought or didn't mean to purchase the service then you may request a refund assuming your request falls within our guidelines. Our refund policy can be found in our terms of service [here](https://aurorahosts.com/tos.pdf).

#### How do I know if I'm eligable?

You're eligable for a refund if the following applies to you:

* Your purchase was made within the last 24 hours.
* Your last payment for your recurring invoice was within the last 24 hours.

:::note
If a chargeback for the payment is open we will **not** provide any refunds until the chargeback has been closed.
:::

### Requesting the refund.

To start the process you'll need to open a ticket in the [billing area](https://billing.aurorahosts.com)

In the ticket you should include the following information:

* **The Invoice # you want refunded.**
ex: Invoice #38200
or
* **The service you want refunded**

If your request falls into the criteria for eligability you'll receive a response in your ticket and a refund within 12-24 hours.

:::warning
After a refund has been processed your service will be terminated and **all the data** will be deleted. Please back up all data prior to a refund request.
