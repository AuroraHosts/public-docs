If you ever need to transfer your server to another person this guide will show you the proper way to start the transfer process.

### Starting the process

1. To start the process you'll need to open a ticket by clicking [here](https://billing.aurorahosts.com/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=3).

2. In this ticket you should include the following
* **The server you wish to transfer**: 
* **The email of the person you'd like the service transfered to**:

3. Once the ticket is open we'll request additional information to confirm the transfer.

If all the steps have been followed properly we'll transfer your service to the person you requested and you'll no longer have access to the server.

:::danger Final warning!
**Transfers are final** and cannot be reversed. Once the process of a transfer is completed we will not comply with any requests to transfer the service back to the original owner.
